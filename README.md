# WandelApp
This app is under construction and has not yet been deployed.
You can start it up for now by running nodemon app.js in Terminal when you are in the main folder. This will run the local server on port 8080.

In your browser type in: localhost:8080.

You should now be able to use the app. Any changes you make to the database will be locally stored.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact me at: 

bosma.jorrit@gmail.com

In the near future I will finish the app, deploy it and start using it with family and friends to share nice walks in the North of the Netherlands.

# Controllers and stars
I learned to make controllers where all the function logic takes place and just call the functions in my routes.

I restructured my routes using the router.route method (comes with Express).

Implemented star ratings using Staribility found on GitHub. Still to be fixed (nice to have): leaving 0 stars validation (now it defaults to 1 star).
